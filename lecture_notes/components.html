<!-- What is a component?
    - components are used to cluster or segragate one chunk of "function" or in laymans term a usage that is used in the app.
    One good things about encapsulating it in a component is that it is reusable and could be called accros the app
    - Advantages:
        * among all the others there are 2 main hidden advantage. First, is that it makes the DOM snappy, components are separated,
        so instead of re-rendering a big chunk of data, it focuses on the component. Second, the classes stays inside the component,
        so for CSS in styling, class names will be prevented to clash

    Components Syntax
    - One thing to note on is that data in here is a function that is called. 

    Slots and Named Slots 
    - Enables me to write a string inside the component, in the template, to render it out, it will look like this:
    - <slot></slot>
    - it can also be named, see example in pt 2 practice, slots

    Props
    - This is another way to populate data inside the components
    - It is used inside the Vue.component as props: [] where it can take 
    data that is inside the component itself. 
        * one weird thing is, props will only accept camelCase, but inside the
        renedered component, I need to use not-camel-case
        * ex
         <div id="app" class="bg-blue-200 w-full h-screen ">
            <title-text user-id="456" :link="{ title: 'Home', link: '#home' }"></title-text>
        </div>
        
        <script>
            Vue.component('title-text', {
                template: '<div>{{ link.title }}</div>', 
                
                props: ['userId', 'link']
            });
